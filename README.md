# chorus
Chorus is a collaborative way for strangers to create music together. Users can individually start and add to music pieces, forming collages of diverse musical styles from across the world. Each measure of music illustrates the perspective of a single individual, but together, a story emerges, demonstrating the profound impact of small actions.

Jump into contributing your musical style and follow the songs you're a part of as they travel the world and see how they've grown.
